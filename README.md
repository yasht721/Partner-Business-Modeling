Assignment
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts. For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

- The KP481 is for mid-level runners and sells for $1,750;
